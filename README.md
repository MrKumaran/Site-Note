**Idea here is to save notes for particular site on browser itself using this extension**

## Why it exist

A lot of times, people bookmark websites but later forget why they bookmarked them.
This can help them save the website URL along with a note explaining why they saved that page.
(Basically, I'm that lot of people, I needed it so build it)
